### TIPS 💡

- Matches of **more than 4 tiles** decrease the associated sidekick's cooldown by one.
  For sidekicks with gauges, it adds a little bonus.
  
- Kill **viruses** first. They can easily ruin a game.

- Don't forget to use the **HOLD** feature !

- The choice of **sidekicks** can be decisive for some levels.
